March-RTS
=========

My March entry for 1GAM.
This is not entirely finished, that's why I made it open source. Maybe someone else wants to fiddle around with this.
You can use this under the LGPL v.3 (see "COPYING" and "COPYING.LESSER" for more information).
Maybe one day I'll return and make it more like I initially intended it to become, but for now this will have to suffice.
It's a NetBeans project, so open and run in NetBeans if you want to.
You can also run from the command line via the "build" directory.
